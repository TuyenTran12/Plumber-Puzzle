## All functions are in the game
For this game, I have consulted a number of articles about Hill Climbing algorithms and relied on them to write code
* Allows the tubes to rotate 90 degrees per click
* Check whether the tubes are correctly positioned based on the Hill Climbing algorithm

## New lesson
* Use algorithms in math problems
  
## Unity version
It has been tested and developed on Unity 2022.3.35f1
